Hi there! I'm Brayan Gomes, a 21 year-old who likes programming and math.

Sometimes both are used to create impressive things in areas like graphics programming, where you use programming, and a ton of math, to create beautiful graphics. Math and programming by themselves are also incredible interesting, like creating a website or splines.

My hobbies are programming, mainly in Java, Kotlin and TypeScript, creating everything from Minecraft Mods/Plugins to WebApps.

Here are a list of interesting things:
